Airbnb Data Analysis Project


This project explores and analyzes Airbnb data using Python. The goal is to clean, transform, and visualize the dataset to extract meaningful insights.


Project Structure

•Airbnb Data-Analysis Project.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
•Dataset (CSV/PDF) → The raw data used for analysis.


Tools & Libraries Used

•Jupyter Notebook
•pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation
•numpy → Numerical operations
•matplotlib / seaborn → Data visualization


Key Steps in Analysis

•Data Cleaning
•Checking and handling missing values
•Removing duplicates


Correcting column names & data types

•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•Summary statistics
•Price distribution
•Room type & location-based analysis

Questions
•What is the distribution of listing prices?
•How are different room types distributed?
•How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods?
•What is the relationship between price and room type?
•How has the number of review change over with time?

Visualization

•Bar charts, histograms, scatter plots
•Correlation heatmaps
•Insights
•Identified missing values and cleaned dataset.

Explored distribution of listings across neighborhoods.

Analyzed pricing trends by room type and location.
